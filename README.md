# House-Price-Prediction
In this project we are creating a model for predicting house prices using different data points values .

## Description

This project will predict the price of the house depending on different parameters.
Using Python as a scripting language , matplotlib for visualization, pandas for data preparation and SKlearn for model building , training and accuracy validation.In this project using different ML algos like DecisionTree , RandomForest , LogisticRegression , SVM , LinearRegression and tried to create the best model possible for predicting the house price 


## Tech Stack

Python, Jupyter Notebook, SKlearn, Machine Learning, Matplotlib.

## Lessons Learned

We have Learned how to clean the data , prepare it and then use it train different model.
one of the main challenges is to optimize our model to reduce the loss on the test data, also choice of the model is also an crucial factor in this case.
